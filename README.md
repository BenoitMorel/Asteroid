# Asteroid (Accurate Species Tree Estimation RObust to Incomplete Data sampling)

Asteroid is a method that infers an unrooted species tree from a set of unrooted gene trees. It is robust to both incomplete lineage sorting and high proportions of missing genes. 

Asteroid computes for each input gene tree a distance matrix based on the gene internode distance. Then, it computes a species tree from this set of distance matrices under the minimum balanced evolution principle.

Asteroid is parallelized, and can take as input multi-furcating and multi-copy gene trees. It can computes bootstrap support values, either from the input gene trees, or from an alternative set of bootstrap gene trees.

For more information about the method, please check our manuscript (TODO!).
